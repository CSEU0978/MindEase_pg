# Basic to-do List
## - For the Prediction Model
1) ~Add word doc to repo~
2) ~Find out the basic data points for the dataset~
3) Make a questionare for the data input (training)
4) Start surveying people
5) Get atleast 50 column entries
6) Make a model that predicts the illness based off data points

## - For the NLP
1) Find out whether to use new or old model for the talking part
2) Find dataset to train off of

## - For the input understanding 
1) Train the model to understand certain keywords
2) Teach it to relate keywords to moods (Sentiment Analysis, Mood Analysis)


## Project To-do's:
1) https://huggingface.co/blog/sentiment-analysis-python; 
2) Start with tokenisation ideation and how to work with it
3) Make a model that predicts depression and other stuff based on rating on the emotion scale
4) Start on the NLP front for making believeable conversations, implent ideas from todolist app
